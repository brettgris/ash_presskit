              <p>"Blunt Talk," a 10-episode half-hour series, set in Los Angeles, follows Walter Blunt, played by Patrick Stewart, a British import intent on conquering the world of American cable news. Through the platform of his nightly news show, Blunt is on a mission to impart his wisdom and guidance on how Americans should live, think and behave.</p>
              <p>Besieged by network bosses, a dysfunctional news staff, numerous ex-wives, children of all ages, and his own well-intentioned, but sometimes misguided decisions, Blunt's only support is in the form of the heavy-drinking, devoted manservant he transplanted from the U.K.</p>
              <p>The cast is led by Patrick Stewart in the role of Walter Blunt, Jacki Weaver as Rosalie, Blunt's tough and motherly producer-manager and Adrian Scarborough as Harry, Blunt's manservant. Dolly Wells who plays Celia, Blunt's senior producer and head writer and Timm Sharp who plays Jim, Blunt's head writer, round out the cast.</p>
              <p>The series from MRC is executive produced by Seth MacFarlane, Jonathan Ames (Creator and Showrunner), Stephanie Davis and Tristram Shapeero.</p>

                  <div class="prod-position">Dept. Head Hair</div>
                  <p>Dunham started in the hair industry in 1994 as general manager and art director at Oxenrose Hair Salon in downtown San Francisco, overseeing 20 stylists and up to 35 staff members. In 2003, he joined the hair and makeup union, local 706, and worked on the TV show &#8220;Desperate Housewives&#8221; until its end in 2012. Since then, he has served as department head and worked on numerous shows including &#8220;Suburgatory,&#8221; &#8220;Guys with Kids,&#8221; &#8220;Matador,&#8221; &#8220;Scorpion,&#8221; &#8220;The Voice,&#8221; &#8220;The Brink&#8221; and &#8220;Shameless.&#8221; In 2013, Dunham served as department head on the feature film &#8220;Rudderless.&#8221;</p>

                  <div class="prod-name">JILL BROWN</div>
                  <div class="prod-position">Stunt Coordinator</div>
                  <p>Born in Baltimore, Brown performed her first stunt when she climbed the ladder of the three-meter high dive (orange arm floaties and all) and jumped into the deep end when she was just two years old. She claimed she was bored in the shallow end.</p>
                  <p>Later in life, being an exceptional, competitive athlete, it seemed fitting that in 1993 Jill&#8217;s physical therapist would introduce her to his friend, local stuntman George Aguilar, urging her to strive for a career that could utilize her expansive, athletic skill set. Impressed by her athleticism and tenacity, Aguilar and his stunt team took Jill under their wing and trained her in all facets of stunt performance and eventually stunt coordinating.</p>
                  <p>Brown has worked on over 100 feature films and television programs. She has won two World Stunt Awards; one for her high work doubling Jennifer Lopez on &#8220;The Cell&#8221; and a few years later for her wire work on &#8220;Taxi.&#8221; She was also nominated for four Screen Actors Guild Awards in a stunt ensemble. In 1998, Brown performed the highest recorded wire descender drop out of a helicopter (250 feet) as well as a 450-foot drop off the roof of the PPG building in Pittsburgh for &#8220;Inspector Gadget.&#8221;</p>
                  <p>Due to her comedic sensibilities and knack for physical comedy, Tina Fey approached Brown while shooting an episode of &#8220;30 Rock.&#8221; Fey promoted her to stunt coordinate the remaining six seasons. Brown went on to coordinate Fey&#8217;s most recent show &#8220;Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.&#8221; Continuing in the comedy field, she also coordinates &#8220;Grace and Frankie&#8221; for Netflix and MTV&#8217;s &#8220;Faking It.&#8221; She has also coordinated &#8220;Confessions of a Shopaholic,&#8221; as well as the 2nd Unit (action unit) for &#8220;Zombieland&#8221; and &#8220;Premium Rush,&#8221; making her one of the only female stunt coordinators in the country.</p>
