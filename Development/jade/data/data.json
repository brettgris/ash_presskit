Released by Universal Republic, the album celebrates the classic, sophisticated sound of the lush swing orchestras of the &#8216;40s and &#8216;50s with MacFarlane singing some of the hidden gems of that era. Norah Jones and Sara Bareilles collaborated with MacFarlane on two duets on the album. In 2014, MacFarlane released his first-ever Christmas album, &#8220;Holiday for Swing,&#8221; that debuted No. 1 on the iTunes holiday album charts. The album features timeless holiday songs accompanied by a 52-piece orchestra.",
